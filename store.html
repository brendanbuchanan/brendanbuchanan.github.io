		<h2>| Home | Computers | Photoshop | Video Editing |</h2>

		<p>Sunset Inc is a company created by me, Brendan Buchanan, that is entirely digital and uses the online website to operate. We have a base of operations in Chicago at an undisclosed location. I like to sell technology that I own, or rather used to own, and want to give it a use instead of sitting there and just gathering dust for an enterity. When I upgrade my own personal setup and I have no use for old technology, I like to sell it off to the highest potential bidder. I also like to price my products, dencently lower so you wont get a better deal anywhere. </p>
